    Domain-Specific language for Theory of Mind reasoning.

    All actions return a boolean that represents whether the action was successfully performed ot not.
    All actions have the same three-step structure (sometimes in different order):
        0. Checking the preconditions to execute the action (e.g. we cannot move an object if it is already there)
        1. Update the story script and update object variables (e.g. self.objects)
        2. Update the world state and the beliefs of all action witnesses
    
    Preconditions need to be checked before any world state or belief update, as there is no way to roll back an update.

    Communication can be about abstract topics (knowledge) or about to communicate something about
    the current world state. This has to be knowledge that the speaker already possesses and needs to match
    the ground truth to simplify and avoid considerations about e.g. outdated information.
